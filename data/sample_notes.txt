Computer Networks: The OSI Model divides network communication into seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application. TCP operates at the Transport layer and provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes. UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee delivery or order. 

In databases, normalization reduces redundancy and improves data integrity. Third Normal Form (3NF) requires that all the attributes are functionally dependent on the primary key and that there are no transitive dependencies.

In algorithms, Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. Its typical time complexity using a binary heap is O((V + E) log V).
